Carina Curto is a Professor of Mathematics at Penn State University. She received an 
A.B. in Physics from Harvard University in 2000 and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Duke 
University in 2005. During her postdoctoral years at Rutgers and NYU, she 
transitioned to research in theoretical and computational neuroscience. Before 
moving to Penn State, Curto was an assistant professor at the University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln (2009-2014). Her research focuses on theory and analysis of neural 
networks and neural codes, motivated by questions of learning, memory, and sequence 
generation in cortical and hippocampal circuits. Curto's work uses and develops 
tools in applied algebra, geometry, topology, and dynamical systems. Her honors 
include a Sloan Research Fellowship (2011), a Woodrow Wilson Career Enhancement 
Fellowship (2012), a Simons Fellowship (2021), and a Faculty Scholar Medal (2020), 
in addition to numerous NSF and NIH research awards.
